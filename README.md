# Time series forecasting scripts

These scripts use ARIMA and LSTM RNN methods for time series forecasting. The series itself must be in CSV format (atleast they need to have timestamp + value columns).

To run these scripts you need to have Python 3 and bunch of it's libraries installed:

* Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
* Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
* Statsmodels (http://www.statsmodels.org/)
* Keras (https://keras.io/)
* Scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/)

To install them, use pip3 installation program.

FYI, I used old version of these scripts in my bachelor thesis.
